Design and implementation of a single tree segmentation project based on LiDar data and aerial photographs

<!--more-->



## Learning objectives
At the end of your project you should be able to
* process optical and LiDAR data to compile a comprehensive dataset for your area of interest,
* design and implement medium complex workflows related to derive LiDAR based inices,
* work in teams on short-term projects and use collaborative project and software development tools,
* sufficiently document your code and analysis workflow for re-usability and scientific review,
* communicate your work in a preliminary online paper.

Please note - same as in Remote Sensing the paradigm is...

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Science is a communication process aiming in creating knowledge based on existing one. This social process requires a transparent discussion of findings within the scientific community and between this community and other social groups. One key aspect is the sufficient documentation of the analysis workflow and its underlaying data basis. If both information is available, the community can cross-check and validate the analysis results and foster knowledge generation by building upon the these results. Keep this in mind while working on your project. As a starting point for further reading we recommend the recommendations on good scientific practice as published in the [white paper on this topic](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/good_scientific_practice/index.html){:target="_blank"} by the German Science Foundation. And do not follow the documentation example below.
