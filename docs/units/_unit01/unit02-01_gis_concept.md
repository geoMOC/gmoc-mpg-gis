The approach to the topic of geographic information systems (GIS) seems unclear for beginners due to the multiple use of the term. It is therefore necessary to explain and define some terms, both from the everyday as well as from the established geographical usage. <!--more-->
This already begins with the terms "geography" and "geographic", which are associated with the perception of the Earth's surface and the understanding and description of the  underlying processes. This brings the transparent and reproducible description of the earth, that is, a scientifically-based abstracted cognitive world experience, into the focus of a first engagement with GIS.


This unit summarizes the basic abstraction and communication concepts of GI systems against the background of application-oriented scientific questions.



## GIS in geo-science

GIS has an not quite well defined background in the geo science community. Obviously, the term GIS is used almost arbitrarily in scientific and planning practice. Also the demarcation of the terms land, geo and space information systems (LIS, GIS and RIS) is not uniformly handled in the technical literature. At present, the term geo information system (GIS) has become established as the superordinate term for spatial information systems for all possible variants. The Anglo-Saxon area is also often talked about by geo information science.

The relationships of the real world are usually so complex that they can only be understood or analyzed in a generalized form. Already in everyday life we constantly construct cognitive models to simplify our perception of the world [Rasch 200 6](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/TIBKAT%3A519823788/Verstehen-abstrakter-Sachverhalte-semantische-Gestalten/?tx_tibsearch_search%5Bsearchspace%5D=tibub){:target="_blank"}. This experience is also known in the sciences. As early as 1927, the physicist Bridgman notes: "I believe that the model is a useful and indeed unescapable tool of thought, in that it enables us to think about the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar" [Bridgman 1927](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2014223?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents){:target="_blank"}, while in 1972 the modeler Rivet simply states: "The History of mankind is the history of model building." (Rivett 1972). As a result the perception and interpretation of the "real world" as well as the development of appropriate strategies for the practical handling of this world, takes place with the aid of abstraction and communication (= modeling).


## Concepts of spatial representation
Geographic or spatial representations are the basis for a scientific interpretation of spatiotemporal aspects of the real world. In science, it is customary for this to be considered as valid rules (axioms). For example, Waldo Tobler has formulated the so-called first geographical law: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" [Tobler 1970](https://www.jstor.org/stable/143141){:target="_blank"}. By contrast, in his action-centered approach, Benno Werlen points out that not only are real neighborhood relationships of objects or feature expressions permitting space constructs, but that spaces can also be defined by e.g. Acting people who do not necessarily act in spatial proximity can be socially constructed (see, for example, [Werlen 1993](https://www.erdkunde.uni-bonn.de/archive/1993/gibt-es-eine-geographie-ohne-raum-zum-verhaeltnis-von-traditioneller-geographie-und-zeitgenoessischen-gesellschaften/at_download/attachment){:target="_blank"}. But even in the quantitatively scientific representation of the world, the concept of neighborhood according to Tobler is only valid for some contexts. For example, the concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere is comparatively homogeneous and continuous, while, for example, geologically continuous units on continental plates or disturbances from one meter to the next virtually counteract the neighborly relationships. So if we define GI systems as tools that can be operated and used according to the rules of information processing, then we have to find a way to define and integrate geographically such conflicting spatial representations in a traceable and reproducible way.

## Limitation of world representations 
Despite these enormous limitations, representations of space are permanently and urgently needed in order to document, analyze and communicate comprehensible spatial information. Often several or variable representations are necessary to represent the reality with sufficient accuracy. If you want to acquire spatial competence, you must consider all the aspects mentioned, and not just the software-specific ones. In the our field of geography, GIS is a combination of methods that make spatio-temporal relationships comprehensible and reproducible.
