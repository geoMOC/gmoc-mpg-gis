We offer weekly input with a new course unit. Depending on the topic, we start this with live streaming, a web conference, videos, texts or other materials. After the input, the exercises are presented, which should be worked on to successfully complete the project. Open questions can be asked at any time during the course or via email. All questions will be discussed in a screencast or online (FAQ). 

## Web-based learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this publicly accessible homepage we create on GitHub. Here you will find learning materials, tasks, and support.

## Flexible learning with fixed deadlines
The course schedule provides for a three-hour block on Tuesdays. These events cannot be offered in classroom form until further notice. However, the logic associated with these events will be maintained. This means the following for you:

Every Tuesday we start with a new course unit. For these you will find new learning materials and new spotlights on this website. These can be videos, texts, references to literature etc. You have until 01.03.2021 to complete the project task.

Apart from the deadlines, you are free to organize your learning and work on the tasks. You can find further information about the exam [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _unit00/unit00-01_notes_on_assignments.md %}))


## Learning with Web Conferences
In addition to providing materials on this website, we want to meet with you in web conferences. This is subject to the expected Internet load and other technical problems that may prevent you from participating in a web conference. Subject to the consent of each participating student, we will record the web conference to provide you to all those who were unable to participate due to technical barriers.

Short-term changes e.g. of the web conference room can always occur. These changes will be communicated to you by email.
